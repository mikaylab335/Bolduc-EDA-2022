## Abstract
- COVID cases have increased among all age groups from December of 2021 going into March of 2022.
- COVID vaccine rates have increased among all age groups and continue to. 
- We couldn't run a statistical test on this data due to the different age groups.
- The increase in both COVID cases and vaccination rates both increased but this doesn't necessarily mean that the vaccines are ineffective.
  - There can be many reasons for this like the different varients become spread at this time.

## Introduction
COVID-19 vaccinations in the U.S. first became available to select populations, such as the elderly and immunocompromised, back in June 2020, right after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March. Fast forward to present day where vaccinations are available to everyone, along with the development of a booster shot. However, since then, vaccines have become a very controversial topic. 

The COVID-19 vaccines were the fastest vaccines to get approved for use. This has led to many people wondering, how effective are these vaccines?
  
In this project, we will be doing an exploratory data analysis on the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of people vaccinated. This will help to show the effectiveness of the vaccine. 

We will be using data from COVID Data Tracker, which is a website managed by the CDC, to look for relationships between positive COVID-19 cases and vaccination status among different age groups. We will be looking at the whole population of the U.S. to get more accurate information on the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. If the vaccine is effective, we should see that as the number of vaccinated people goes up, the amount of COVID-19 cases will go down.

## Results



## Discussion
We were unable to run a statistical test on this data due to the age groups being different between the different data sets that we used.
