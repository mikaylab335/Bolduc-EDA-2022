## Abstract

-   COVID cases have increased among all age groups from December of 2021 going into March of 2022.

-   COVID vaccine rates have increased among all age groups and continue to.

-   We couldn't run a statistical test on this data due to the different age groups.

-   The increase in both COVID cases and vaccination rates both increased but this doesn't necessarily mean that the vaccines are ineffective.

    -   There can be many reasons for this like the different variants become spread at this time.

-   Ran a Chi-squared test on the total cases from 2020 and 2021 and found that 2021 was statistically significant and higher than 2020.
