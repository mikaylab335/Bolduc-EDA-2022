# Correlation Between COVID Cases and Vaccination Status Among Different Age Groups in the U.S.

## Abstract

-   COVID cases have increased among all age groups from December of 2021 going into March of 2022.

-   COVID vaccine rates have increased among all age groups and continue to.

-   We couldn't run a statistical test on this data due to the different age groups.

-   The increase in both COVID cases and vaccination rates both increased but this doesn't necessarily mean that the vaccines are ineffective.

    -   There can be many reasons for this like the different variants being spread at this time. Such as the Omicron variant that was between December 2021-March 2022.

## Introduction

COVID-19 vaccinations in the U.S. first became available to select populations, such as the elderly and immunocompromised, back in June 2020, right after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March. Fast forward to present day where vaccinations are available to everyone, along with the development of a booster shot. However, since then, vaccines have become a very controversial topic.

The COVID-19 vaccines were the fastest vaccines to get approved for use. This has led to many people wondering, how effective are these vaccines?

In this project, we will be doing an exploratory data analysis on the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of people vaccinated. This will help to show the effectiveness of the vaccine.

We will be using data from COVID Data Tracker, which is a website managed by the CDC, to look for relationships between positive COVID-19 cases and vaccination status among different age groups. We will be looking at the whole population of the U.S. to get more accurate information on the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. If the vaccine is effective, we should see that as the number of vaccinated people goes up, the amount of COVID-19 cases will go down.

## Methods

### Data Acquisition

COVID data: Cases

1.  Go to <https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/downloadable-datasets.html>
2.  Scroll to the "Daily Age Group Outcomes" download and click
3.  Click on "Show in folder"
4.  Copy data set
5.  Paste in data folder (Public_Dataset_Age_1\_)

COVID data: Vaccination Status

1.  Go to <https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccination-Demographics-in-the-United-St/km4m-vcsb>
2.  Scroll to "View Data"
3.  Click on the Export Tab
4.  Click on CSV
5.  Save to data folder (COVID_19_Vaccination_Demographics_in_the_United_States_National_1\_.csv)

-   Print both data sets into an Rscript in R
-   Filter data set to get the variables that are needed for this project
-   Graph the data sets

## Results

```{r read-data}
library(tidyverse)

ages <- tibble(
  age_group = c("5-11", "12-17", "18-24", 
                "25-39", "40-49", "50-64", "65-74", "75+"),
  age_start = c(5, 12, 18, 25, 40, 50, 65, 75),
  age_end = c(12, 18, 25, 40, 50, 65, 75, 89)
) %>% 
  mutate(age_group = as_factor(age_group))

## vaccination
# raw data
vax_data <- 
  read_csv("data/COVID-19_Vaccination_Demographics_in_the_United_States_National.csv") %>% 
  filter(str_starts(Demographic_category, "Ages_")) %>% 
  rename(age_group = Demographic_category) %>% 
  mutate(
    Date = as.Date(Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"),
    age_group=str_remove(age_group, "Ages_"),
    age_group=str_remove(age_group, "_yrs"),
    age_group=str_remove(age_group, "yrs"),
  ) %>% 
  # filter(!age_group %in% c("<12", "<5", "12-15", "16-17")) %>%
  mutate(age_group = factor(age_group, levels = ages$age_group)) %>%
  inner_join(ages) %>%
  # filter(is.na(age_group2)) %>%
  # select(starts_with("age"))
rename(
    per_vax = Series_Complete_Pop_pct_agegroup, 
    date = Date
  ) %>% 
  select(date, starts_with("age"), per_vax)
```

This is the first graph I made that looked at the percent of fully vaccinated people in each age group. This defines fully vaccinated by having a full vaccination plus the booster.

```{r first-graph}
vax_data %>% 
  filter(date == max(date)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x=age_group, y=per_vax), 
           fill = "darkseagreen") +
  labs(y="% Fully Vaccinated", x="Age", title = "Vaccination Status for the US as of March 27, 2022")+
  theme_gray(base_size = 15)
```

This is the first graph but I changed it to make the columns to being the width of the age group since not all the age groups were over the same range in ages.

```{r second-graph}
vax_data %>% 
  filter(date == max(date)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = age_start, xmax = age_end, ymin = 0, ymax = per_vax), 
            fill = "darkseagreen", color = "azure") +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = age_start, xmax = age_end, ymin = per_vax, ymax = 100), 
            fill = "azure3", color = "azure") +
  labs(y="% Fully Vaccinated", x="Age", title = "Vaccination Status for the US as of March 27, 2022")+
  theme_gray(base_size = 15)
```

This is a time-wise graph of vaccination rates and it shows when each of these age groups were getting the vaccine while also showing the percent of the age group vaccinated at a point in time.

```{r third-graph}
# line graph 
vax_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = per_vax, color = age_group)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(y="% Fully Vaccinated", x="Date", title = "Vaccination Status for the US as of March 27, 2022")+
  theme_gray(base_size = 15)
```

```{r read-second-data}
library(readxl)
cases_by_age <- 
  read_excel("data/Public-Dataset-Age.XLSX") %>% 
  select(-c(AR_TOTALPERCENT, AR_NEWCASES, 
            AR_NEWPERCENT, AR_TOTALDEATHS, AR_NEWDEATHS)) %>% 
  rename(date = DATE, age_range=AGE_RANGE, total_cases=AR_TOTALCASES) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))
```

This graph is showing the number of cases for the age groups being compared from December 1, 2021 and March 26, 2022 all in one single graph.

```{r fourth-graph}
cases_by_age %>%
  # filter(date == max(date)) %>%    # choose the last date
  filter(date == as.Date("2022-03-26") | date == as.Date("2021-12-01")) %>%   # choose a particular date
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x=age_range, y=total_cases, fill=as.factor(date)),
           position="dodge2") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("darkseagreen", "azure3")) +
  labs(y="# of Cases", x="Age Group", title="COVID-19 Cases Among  Age Groups") +
  theme_gray(base_size = 15)
```

This shows each of the age groups, each with its own graph, so we can look at each individual age group compared to itself from December 1, 2021 and March 26, 2022.

```{r fifth-graph}
cases_by_age %>% 
  filter(date == as.Date("2022-03-26") | date == as.Date("2021-03-01")) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = date, y = total_cases),
           fill = "darkseagreen") +
  facet_wrap(~ age_range)+
  labs(y="Total Cases", x="Date", title = "COVID Cases in the US (December 1, 2021 and March 26, 2022)")+
  theme_gray(base_size = 15)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=rel(.8)))
```

This shows each age group each with its own graph again but between December 1, 2020 and December 1, 2021. We can see an overall increase within this year timeline.

```{r sixth-graph}
# New multiple graph
cases_by_age %>% 
  filter(date == as.Date("2020-12-01") | date == as.Date("2021-12-01")) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = date, y = total_cases),
           fill = "darkseagreen") +
  facet_wrap(~ age_range)+
  labs(y="Total Cases", x="Date", title = "COVID Cases in the US (December 1, 2020 and December 1, 2021)")+
  theme_gray(base_size = 15)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=rel(.8)))
ggsave("figs/case data.png", height = 8, width = 12, units="in", dpi=600)
```

I wanted to look at the statistical significance between the total number of cases between 2020 and 2021 between the age groups to see if the total cases were significantly different. My Chi-square test found the total cases from 2020 and 2021 to be statistically significant (X^2^ = 5154.5, df = 9, p \< 0.05).

```{r chi-square-test, echo=FALSE}
cases_by_age %>% 
  filter(date == as.Date("2020-12-01") | date == as.Date("2021-12-01")) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.factor(lubridate::year(date))) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "date", values_from = "total_cases") %>% 
  select(-age_range) %>% 
  as.matrix() %>% 
  chisq.test()
```

## Discussion

We were unable to run a statistical test between the two different data sets and results due to the age groups being different between the data sets that we used. We can, however, do a statistical test within the data set on its own.
